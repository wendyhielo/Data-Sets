This data set is on police fatalities from 2000 to 2016.
I observed that the majority of the people that got into these situations did not flee.
So if a person has an encounter with a poolice officer then the chances of them fleeing is really low.

The steps i used to view the data and arrive to this observation was:
- I first downloaded the data set.
- I opened it with excel

The steps i took to get to this hypothesis are:
- I used the COUNTIF function and for the parameters
  -  I did from line 2 to 12492 (The first line had all the titles)
  -  The second parameter was "false" (These were all the people that did not flee)
- To get the percentage of the hypothesis I divided the people who didn't flee with the overall number of people
- This then brought the conclusion of 0.4% of the people did not flee

The conclusion derived from this is that people don't normally flee when having an encounter with a police officer but they still get killed. Only 0.4% of the people fleed which means that 96% of them didnt. Now another thing is if maybe the type of weapon used causes them to flee.

If a cop takes out their gun then the chances of people fleeing is less. 

The steps to get to the conclusion were: 
- Used a COUNTIF function and for parameters
  - Did from line 2 to 12283 which were all the people who were shot
  - Second parameter was "true" which was all that people that did flee
- The conclusion i got was that 560 people fled 
- This then got me to the conclusion that out of all the people that fled they were all shot.

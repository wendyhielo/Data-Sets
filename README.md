This data set is on police fatalities from 2006 to 2012.
I observed that the majority of the people that got into these situations did not flee.
I hypothesize that less than 10% of the people tried to flee.

The steps i used to view the data and arrive to this observation was:
- I first downloaded the data set.
- I opened it with excel

The steps i took to get to this hypothesis are:
- I used the COUNTIF function and for the parameters
  -  I did from line 2 to 12492 (The first line had all the titles)
  -  The second parameter was "false" (These were all the people that did not flee)
